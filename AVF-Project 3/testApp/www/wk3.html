	<h1>Question 1: What type of native features would you be able to implement using html/css/js only?</h1>
	<h2>It's pretty hard to tell from the links provided which native features can be implemented by only using html/css/js.  However, it does seem like all of them can be implemented by using PhoneGap.</h2>

	<h1>Question 2: For your CRUD app - which will you implement?</h1>
	<h2>I'd like to implement the camera into my app so that you can take a picture of a gift you want to buy or have bought and it will put it with the listed birthday.</h2>

					<h1>Question 3: Past lessons learned dealing with workflow?</h1>
					<h2>I like to plan out my app by drawing the layout so I have a good idea of where I want elements to go and how I want the app to flow.  Time management is also very important to me.  Of course, with all the problems I'm having setting up and getting xCode to work - time management has gone out the window.  So, to me, planning and time management are the most important lessons learned.</h2>

					<h1>Question 4: Describe design intentions for AVF Demo app and the new Crud app?</h1>
					<h2>I'm working on the layout and design of my Demo page now.  In the end I want it to be Responsive and adjust content based on what device is using it.  My app will go from a Christmas Gift app to a Birthday app instead.  I need to implement the camera into this app so that when you purchase a gift for someone you can put a picture in the file.  Also, I would like it to let you choose a picture from the photo album to use when you ADD a birthday.</h2>
