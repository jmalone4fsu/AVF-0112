	<h1>Question 1: What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</h1>
	<h2>The most popular categories are games, news, maps, social networking and music.</h2>
</section>
<section role="main">
	<h1>Question 2: What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?</h1>
	<h2>The most popular categories are social networking (texting), AR (Augmented Reality), e-commerce, and games</h2>
</section>

	<h1>Question 3: What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</h1>
	<h2>The most popular categories in Great Britain are entertainment, music, and games</h2>
</section>
<section role="main">
	<h1>Question 4: Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</h1>
	<h2>US/UK markets are geared towards games and entertainment.  Japan market trends towards productive apps for networking and e-commerce.</h2>
</section>
<section role="main">
	<h1>Question 5: What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S? in Japan? in Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?</h1>
	<h2>From all the reports I've researched, less than 1% of worldwide Android phones are on the latest/greatest OS.  What's more interesting is the fact that 3/4 of the Android phones in the global market will NEVER see an update to the latest/greatest OS.</h2>

	<h1>Question 6: What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</h1>
	<h2>Just recently in the US, most mobile providers have dropped the unlimited plans or throttled them.  The UK, average cost is $44/month for unlimited bandwidth (some throttling occurs). In Japan, most carriers provide unlimited bandwidth at the four times faster speeds than the US.</h2>
	<h2>It's important to remember data charges and speeds when developing an app so that you don't abuse these limits for your users.
</section>
<section role="main">
	<h1>Question 7: And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</h1>
	<h2>US/UK - I would suggest gaming or social network projects for the US/UK markets.  When marketing in Japan, AR and social networking.  Any project that is bandwidth intensive I would push towards the Japan markets where speeds are blazing fast and bandwidth is unlimited.</h2>
